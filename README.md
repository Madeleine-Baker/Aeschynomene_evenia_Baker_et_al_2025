Macros used for semi-automatic measurement of brown root suface.
Macro1 is used to define ROIs for each root, creating a mask.
Macro2 is to open previously generated mask, adjust manually the ROIs for each root then through saturation settings 
(to be modified for each experimental setup), generate new ROIs of total root surface that are measured then measure brown surface within root surface ROI.
